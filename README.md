# Car Price Prediction

- Predicted the price of used cars using machine learning techniques.
- Investigated the application of supervised machine learning methods to forecast the price of used cars in India.
- The predictions were based on a dataset collected from Kaggle.
- The dataset contained information about the cars, such as the name of the car, the year it was made, the selling price, the present price, the number of kilometers it has been driven, the fuel type, the seller type, the transmission type, the number of owners, and the mileage of the car.
- The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before being used to train the machine learning models.
- Employed various techniques, including linear regression and lasso regression, to make these predictions.
- Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.
- The results showed that the models were able to predict the price of used cars with reasonable accuracy.
